## Building

To check the code style and build binaries, you can simply run:

```bash
make build
```

Notice DM supports building with Go version `Go >= 1.11.4`, and unit test preparation can be found in [Running/Unit Test](tests/README.md#Unit-Test)

If you only want to build binaries, you can run:
```bash
make dm-worker  # build DM-worker

make dm-master  # build DM-master

make dmctl      # build dmctl
``` 

When DM is built successfully, you can find binaries in the `bin` directory.

## Run Test

Run all tests, including unit test and integration test

```bash
make test
```
