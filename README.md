## Documentation

* [Detailed documentation](https://pingcap.com/docs/tools/dm/overview/)
* [简体中文文档](https://pingcap.com/docs-cn/tools/dm/overview/)

## Building

To check the source code, run test cases and build binaries, you can simply run:

```bash
make build
```

Notice DM supports building with Go version `Go >= 1.11.4`, and unit test preparation can be found in [Running/Unit Test](tests/README.md#Unit-Test)

If you only want to build binaries, you can run:
```bash
make dm-worker  # build DM-worker

make dm-master  # build DM-master

make dmctl      # build dmctl
``` 

When DM is built successfully, you can find binaries in the `bin` directory.
