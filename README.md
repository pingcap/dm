**DM** is an integrated platform, supports migrating data from MySQL/MariaDB to TiDB.

## Architecture

![architecture](docs/media/dm-architecture.png)

## Documentation

* [Detailed documentation](https://pingcap.com/docs/tidb-data-migration/stable/)
* [简体中文文档](https://pingcap.com/docs-cn/tidb-data-migration/stable/)

## Building

To check the code style and build binaries, you can simply run:

```bash
make build
```

Notice DM supports building with Go version `Go >= 1.11.4`, and unit test preparation can be found in [Running/Unit Test](tests/README.md#Unit-Test)

If you only want to build binaries, you can run:
```bash
make dm-worker  # build DM-worker

make dm-master  # build DM-master

make dmctl      # build dmctl
``` 

When DM is built successfully, you can find binaries in the `bin` directory.

## Run Test

Run all tests, including unit test and integration test

```bash
make test
```

## Installing

* The best way to install DM is via [DM-Ansible](https://pingcap.com/docs/tools/dm/deployment/)
* deploy DM manually
  ```
  # Download the DM package.
  wget http://download.pingcap.org/dm-latest-linux-amd64.tar.gz
  wget http://download.pingcap.org/dm-latest-linux-amd64.sha256

  # Check the file integrity. If the result is OK, the file is correct.
  sha256sum -c dm-latest-linux-amd64.sha256

  # Extract the package.
  tar -xzf dm-latest-linux-amd64.tar.gz
  cd dm-latest-linux-amd64
  ```

## Config File

* all sample config files can be found in directory `conf` of dm tarball
* sample config file of dm-master: `bin/dm-master -print-sample-config`
* sample config file of dm-worker: `bin/dm-worker -print-sample-config`
