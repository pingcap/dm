[**TiDB Data Migration (DM)**](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb-data-migration/stable) is an integrated data migration task management platform that supports full data migration and incremental data replication from MySQL/MariaDB into [TiDB](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/stable). It helps reduce the operations cost and simplify the troubleshooting process.

## Documentation

* [简体中文文档](https://pingcap.com/docs-cn/tidb-data-migration/stable/)

## Building

To check the code style and build binaries, you can simply run:

```bash
make build
```

Note that DM supports building with Go version `Go >= 1.11.4`, and unit test preparation can be found in [Running/Unit Test](tests/README.md#Unit-Test)

If you only want to build binaries, you can run:

```bash
make dm-worker  # build DM-worker

make dm-master  # build DM-master

make dmctl      # build dmctl
``` 

When DM is built successfully, you can find binaries in the `bin` directory.

## Run tests

Run all tests, including unit tests and integration tests:

```bash
make test
```
