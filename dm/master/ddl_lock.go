/*
 * sharding DDL sync description
 *
 * assumption:
 * 1. every table in the database is sharding, and must wait for other dm-workers to sync before continue
 * 2. sub task process unit hangs up before sharding DDL resolved
 *    so, every process unit only waiting for one DDL to resolve at one time
 *
 * DDL (lock) info communication:
 *   dm-worker: gRPC server
 *   dm-master: gRPC client
 *   bidirectional streaming RPC between dm-worker and dm-master
 *   do ping-pong on stream
 *     Send / Recv on dm-worker
 *     Recv / Send on dm-master
 *
 * one DDL lock can do re-try-sync by same dm-worker multi times, reentrant
 *
 * normal work flow
 * 1. sub task process unit encounters DDL when syncing
 * 2. process unit saves DDL info and hangs self up
 * 3. dm-worker fetches saved DDL info, and tries to sending it to dm-master
 *    if sends fail, saves DDL info back, and returns to wait dm-master retry on stream
 *    when dm-master retrying on stream, continue from STEP-3
 * 4. dm-master receives DDL info from stream
 *    if receives fail, closes the stream and retries requests on new stream when timeout
 *    when retrying on new stream, dm-worker re-sends DDL info in STEP-3
 * 5. dm-master tries sync DDL lock, and sends results back to dm-worker
 *    if sends fail, closes the stream and retries requests on new stream when timeout
 *    when retrying on new stream, dm-worker re-sends DDL info in STEP-3
 * 6. dm-worker receives DDL lock info
 *    if receives fail, saves DDL info back, and returns to wait dm-master retry on new stream
 *    when dm-master retrying on new stream, continue from STEP-3
 * 7. dm-worker records DDL lock info
 *    if records fail, log error
 *    * this may affect the following DDL lock resolve, user need to use dmctl to handle
 * 8. dm-master sends DDL lock resolve request to dm-worker when lock synced
 * 9. dm-worker executes DDL or ignores (skips) DDL
 *    if executes fail, user need to use dmctl to handle
 * 10. process unit continues execution
 *
 * cases that need dmctl to force to unlock / resolve DDL lock
 * 1. some dm-workers offline, so they can not sync the DDL lock
 *    use dmctl to force dm-workers to try-resolve DDL lock (execute / skip the DDL)
 * 2. dm-workers for the same task are syncing on different DDL locks, like
 *    dm-worker-A is syncing on ddl-lock-A, dm-worker-B is syncing on ddl-lock-B
 *    use dmctl to force dm-workers to try-resolve ddl-lock-A or / and ddl-lock-B
 * 3. some dm-workers occurred error when recording DDL lock info
 *    when resolving DDL lock, the dm-worker can not match the DDL lock info
 *    use dmctl to force the dm-worker to execute / skip the DDL which current is blocking
 * 4. some dm-workers occurred error when executing DDL
 *    use dmctl to force the dm-worker to execute / skip the DDL which current is blocking
 * 5. DDL lock info lost after dm-master restarted
 *    use dmctl to force the dm-worker to execute / skip the DDL which current is blocking
 *
 * dmctl operations to handle abnormal cases
 * 1. force dm-master to resolve un-synced DDL lock
 *    dm-workers will try execute / skip the DDL
 *    supporting use a different dm-worker to replace the owner to execute the DDL
 * 2. force dm-worker to execute / skip the DDL which current is blocking
