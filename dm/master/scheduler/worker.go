// valid transformation:
//   - Offline -> Free, receive keep-alive.
//   - Free -> Offline, lost keep-alive.
//   - Free -> Bound, bind source.
//   - Free -> Relay, start relay for a source.
//   - Bound -> Offline, lost keep-alive, when receive keep-alive again, it should become Free.
//   - Bound -> Free, unbind source.
//   - Bound -> Relay, commands like transfer-source that gracefully unbind a worker which has started relay.
//   - Relay -> Offline, lost keep-alive.
//   - Relay -> Free, stop relay.
//   - Relay -> Bound, old bound worker becomes offline so bind source to this worker, which has started relay.
// invalid transformation:
//   - Offline -> Bound, must become Free first.
//   - Offline -> Relay, must become Free first.
// in Bound stage relay can be turned on/off, the difference with Bound-Relay transformation is
//   - Bound stage turning on/off represents a bound DM worker receives start-relay/stop-relay, source bound relation is
//     not changed.
//   - Bound-Relay transformation represents source bound relation is changed.
// caller should ensure the correctness when invoke below transformation methods successively. For example, call ToBound
//   twice with different arguments.
