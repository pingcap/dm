# TiDB Configuration.

# alter-primary-key is used to control alter primary key feature. Default is false, indicate the alter primary key feature is disabled.
# If it is true, we can add the primary key by "alter table". However, if a table already exists before the switch is turned true and the data type of its primary key column is an integer,
# the primary key cannot be dropped.
