## Preparations

1. The following five executables must be copied or generated or linked into these locations:

    * `bin/tidb-server`
    * `bin/sync_diff_inspector`
    * `bin/mydumper`
    * `bin/dm-master.test` # generated by `make dm_integration_test_build`
    * `bin/dm-worker.test` # generated by `make dm_integration_test_build`

2. The following programs must be installed:

    * `mysql` (the CLI client)

3. The user executing the tests must have permission to create the folder `/tmp/dm_test`. All test artifacts will be written into this folder.

## Running

1. Run `make dm_integration_test_build` to generate DM related binary for integration test

2. Run `make integration_test` to execute the integration tests. This command will

    1. Check that all required executables exist.
    2. Execute `tests/run.sh`

3. After executing the tests, run `make coverage` to get a coverage report at `/tmp/dm_test/all_cov.html`.

## Writing new tests

New integration tests can be written as shell scripts in `tests/TEST_NAME/run.sh`. The script should exit with a nonzero error code on failure.

Several convenient commands are provided:

* `run_dm_master <WORKDIR> <PORT> <CONFIG>` — Starts `dm-master` using config provided, on given port, running in workdir.
* `run_dm_worker <WORKDIR> <PORT> <CONFIG>` — Starts `dm-worker` using config provided, on given port, running in workdir.
* `run_sql <SQL> <PORT>` — Executes an SQL query in database based on port provided
* `run_sql_file <path_to_SQL_file> <PORT>` — Executes all SQLs in given file to the database on port provided
* `check_contains <TEXT>` — Checks if the previous `run_sql`/`run_sql_file` result contains the given text (in `-E` format)
* `check_sync_diff <WORKDIR> <CONFIG>` - Runs `sync_diff_inspector` to check diff between databases, using config file provided
* `check_port_alive <PORT>` - Wrapper to check a port is alive, at most 20 times.
* `check_port <HOST> <PORT>` - Checks a host:port is alive.
